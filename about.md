After graduating in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, and a few brief stints of corporate work, James left for an extended sabatical to travel the world. He ended up settling in Cuenca, Ecuador in 2006 with his partner Carola.

James turned to web development to sustain his travels and began learning the emerging Web standards of the day. In 2007/08, as the number of website projects steadily increased, he carefully compiled his ideas into a custom <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> written in Classic ASP VBScript.

As the inevitable frustration grew with being the sole maintainer of a codebase written in an aging language, he turned to PHP, Drupal, and the thriving open source community —  embracing the concept of <em>standing on the shoulders of giants</em> instead of writing everything from scratch.

Today James contributes to various Open Source projects on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com/jameswilson) and [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/jwilson3).
