This is a ridiculous presentation system that works great for
creative, hurried people. See [the demo](http://macwright.org/big)
for an example of it working.

It makes text and images as big as they can be, gives you minimal
styling (`em`), and gives you left/right arrows for navigation.

## Quickstart

You can skip every step by doing

    curl -O http://mdznr.github.io/big/quickstart.html

This is a **bundle of all JS, CSS, and HTML code** - which means that it's
a bit harder to update, but there are **no external dependencies** here,
so no conference-wifi-pwn.

## Open Source

* Big is awesomer because [lambda](https://github.com/lambda) contributed to it! And you can too: it's Public Domain, CC0.

## HTML5

Big is totally HTML5! It uses the HTML5 doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`!
It's therefore imbued with standardslicious hypeclouds.

## Source

The source looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title></title><link href='big.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /><script src='big.js'></script></head><body>
<div>Big</div>

<div><em>images too</em></div>
