We arrived in<strong> Baños de Ambato</strong> which is uniquely situated at the foot of <strong>Volcán Tungurahua</strong> in a steep and very long valley where Río Pastaza and a few others converge to connect the <em>sierra</em> to the <em>selva</em> (the mountains to the jungle). The place has really grown up around the tourist industry as a jumping off place for jungle tours,  volcano viewing tours, rafting, canyoning, rock climbing, and mountaineering trips.  There is a hostel on every corner, right next to the adventure tour agency, right next to the taffy store?? go figure. Apparently, before the town became a bustling tourist hub, it was known for a unique taffy called <em>melcocha</em> made from the brown blocks of raw cane sugar called <em>panela</em>.

We got to town late and so we just took the first hostel we could get to, which was a nice one, but Sunday we got up and went in search of a better deal.  We found a couple nicer ones for the same price, but settled with <strong>Pension Patty at a whopping three dollars per person,</strong> a double with shared bath at the end of the hall. It was my turn to get the flimsy bed, so yes I tossed and turned all night. The truth is that every place we have stayed thus far, one bed is good and one bed is horrible; and, often we don't figure that out until the next morning.

Around noon we moved our stuff over to the new hotel and went in search of a rafting tour for later that afternoon.  We finally found one after checking about 3 or 4 tour agencies.  So we tagged along with a group of gringos that were volunteering at an elementary school some ways away and were here for the weekend vacationing. A couple Brits, two Americanas from Cali, and a German we were nine in all and the group took two rafts. The waters were low (Class 2-3 only) and there wasn't much adrenaline rush for me but it was fun none-the-less and the clouds rolled away for excellent views of the smoking Tungurahua.   One of the girls had a digi cam and took pictures of the trip and I&rsquo;m awaiting her reply with some pics attached and I&rsquo;ll get them on here asap.

After the trip everyone met up at a local bar, and I wasn't really interested in drinking so i went across the street and attempted the rock wall that was just erected in place of what looked like a pile of rubble from some previous attempt to construct a building. The top-roped route was actually quite difficult with a decent overhang and only small nubs near the top. After everyone from that group left the town was fairly dead for a Sunday night so we crashed out early.
