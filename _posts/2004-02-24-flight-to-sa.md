We got tickets to Ecuador yesterday. (<a href="http://www.grupotaca.com/">www.groupotaca.com</a> - very inexpensive) Leaving out of Miami on March 2nd, return flight set for July 15.  We have to figure out how to get to Miami... and the solution was a one-way ticket on greyhound from Charlotte to Miami (something like a 20 hour bus ride, yikes...  just a little taste of more good things to come...)

We are flying into Ecuador's largest city called Guayaquil, a port city near the Pacific coast. We are going to head north a little ways to stay with a friend at the little surfer town of Monta√±ita (reportedly best waves in Ecuador... a point break... I'll find out more when I get there;-) The plan is to do a big loop around Ecuador going up into the Sierra check out Quito, maybe climb Cotopaxi and then head down into peru.
