title: Millennium Goals to Eradicate Poverty

Today I became inspired after reading about the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Goals</a> set in place by the UN to be achieved by 2015.  The engineer in me decided to dig in a bit deeper and see just what kind of <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/mi_goals.asp">statistics</a> are being used to back up these goals where i found some really interesting information.  

For me, one of the most important of these goals is the eradication of poverty.  

During my trip through south america i witnessed first hand exactly how the greediness of a few rich people really affects huge amounts of people in the world and was appalled at how the distribution of wealth in countries like Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Paraguay is horribly skewed against the vast majority of the population.  

What amazed me the most was that while these countries have high poverty level indicators,  there are many african countries that are triple that of  the andean regions.  

This brings up the question: 

<h4>What can you and I do to help?</h4>

Well for starters go see <a href="http://one.org" title="www.ONE.org">www.ONE.org</a> and help this movement maintain its momentum.
