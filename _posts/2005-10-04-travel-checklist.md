Globetrekking takes guts and a little bit of planning. Here's my personal check list of items not to leave at home.

<!--more-->

I've chosen to keep brand names down to a minimum with the hopes that people will make their own informed decisions on products to purchase. exceptions were made for brands that define a product, e.g. Band-Aid or Zip-Lock.

## Clothing &amp; Threads

In general, nylon/polyester blends and synthetics are cherished among travelers because they dry quicker, pack smaller, and weigh less when wet. other advantages include the ability to wick sweat away from your body and maintain comfort in nearly any climate or condition.

*   sleep sheet - silk or synthetic wicking recommended
*   super-absorbent travel towel one medium/body sized and one small
    face-cloth.
*   rain gear (expensive) or a poncho (affordable)
*   fleece jacket
*   tee-shirts, tank tops, easy to buy/replace along the way
*   button-down long sleve shirt (wrinkle-resistance cotton or comfortable
    synthetic)
*   long pants  (brushed nylon for quick drying, denim for comfort/style)
*   shorts that can double as swiming trunks
*   3 pair of socks - some smart synthetics are highly recommended
*   3 pair of boxers/briefs - some smart synthetics are highly recommended
*   stuff sack / containers for clothing

## Staying connected

Here are a few things to occupy your time before you leave home...

1.   Create email distribution lists, one for friends and another for family.
2.   Create a blog. <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> or <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> are free alternatives.  There are also tons of specialized travel journal communities that help set you up with a website thats ready out of the box for charting your travels.
3.   Create an online photo album: <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> or <a href="https://photos.google.com">Google Photos</a> are ubiquitous free options, but you can also find Wordpress plugins to host the photos on your own server.
4.   Scan all important documents and email them to yourself.


## Preparing for your trip

*   Google your destinations. (do I even need to suggest this?)
*   A good place to explore is <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/">The Lonely Planet worldguide</a>.
*   Get intimate with your guidebook; this will be your *bible* while you are on the road.
*   Scour the <a href="http://thorntree.lonelyplanet.com">thorntree travel forums</a> for posts about your intended destination, there are many people currently traveling where you are about to be so its a good idea to see whats going on.
*   Buy a big map and study the routes, cities, towns, and topography of the entire country / region.  Even though the guidebooks have plenty of maps, you'll appreciate having a nice big one to reference when you need to plan logistics and get a better idea of distances and terrain between stops.  is there even a road that will take you to that remote pueblo in the jungle?
*   Prepare a narrative or powerpoint of where you are from, with maps, pictures of family and friends, and local things of interest from your part of the world.  Make it humorous if possible :) great for showing host families or giving presentations to school children.
