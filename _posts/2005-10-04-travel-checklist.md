Globetrekking takes guts and a little bit of planning. Here's my personal check list of items not to leave at home. a special thanks to <a href="http://solbeam.com/">sol</a> whose personal <a href="http://journals.fotki.com/solbeam/packinglist/">packing list</a> is where I found much of the items listed here.

I've chosen to keep brand names down to a minimum with the hopes that people will make their own informed decisions on products to purchase. exceptions were made for brands that "define" a product,  e.g. Band-Aid or Zip-Lock

<h3>Clothing &amp; Threads</h3>

In general, nylon/polyester blends and synthetics are cherished among travelers because they dry quicker, pack smaller, and weigh less when wet. other advantages include the ability to "wick" sweat away from your body and maintain comfort in nearly any climate or condition.

	<li>create an online photo album: <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr.com</a> is ubiquitous, but you can also find wordpress plugins to host the photos on your own server.</li>
	<li>scan all important documents and email them to yourself</li>
</ol>

<h3>Preparing for your trip</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Google your destination. (do i even need to suggest this?)</li>
	<li>a good place to gather general info is <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/">The Lonely Planet worldguide</a>.</li>
	<li>get intimately familiar with your guidebook of choice, this will be your <em>bible</em> while you are on the road.</li>
	<li>scour the <a href="http://thorntree.lonelyplanet.com">thorntree travel forums</a> for posts about your intended destination, there are many people currently traveling where you are about to be so its a good idea to see whats going on.</li>
	<li>buy a big map and study the routes, cities, towns, and topography of the entire country / region.  even though the guidebooks have plenty of maps, you'll appreciate having a nice big one to reference when you need to plan logistics and get a better idea of distances and terrain between stops.  is there even a road that will take you to that remote pueblo in the jungle?</li>
	<li>prepare a narrative or powerpoint of where you are from, with maps, pictures of family and friends, and local things of interest from your part of the world.  Make it humorous if possible :) great for showing host families or giving presentations to school children</li>
</ul>
