We decided to take a trip a bit to the south to see the artsy hippy town of *El Bolsón*. "Comunidad no nuclear" the sign read, as we arrived in town. Interpret that as you wish.  We *shlightly overshlept* after a long night and didn't quite make it in time to catch the morning bus.<!--more--> The late-sleeper 11:00 gringo bus was full. Soooooo, we sat in the Bariloche bus station playing Hearts till noon-thirty. Card gameing to pass idle time with random travelers abounds on the gringo trail is a common enough refrain.

El Bolsón was not quite worth the trouble and time but they did have an interesting *feria artesanal* (crafts fair). Some unique woodwork and knitting, homemade incense, and great empanadas: just what you would expect from a south american hippy commune.  We hiked up to a mirador overlooking a clear river just as the sunset and then back to the bus stop to return to the big city Bariloche—a decidedly uneventful yet beautiful excursion worth a couple verbal sketches in the journal.
