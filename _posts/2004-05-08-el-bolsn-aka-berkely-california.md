We decided to take a trip a bit to the south to see the artsy hippy-ish town of El Bolsón "comunidad no nuclear" as the sign read as we arrived in town (interpret that as you wish).  We shlightly overshlept after a long night and didn't quite make it in time to catch the morning bus, and then the 11:00 bus was full, soooooo we sat in the Bariloche bus station playing Hearts till noon-thirty (card gameing to pass idle time with random travelers abounds on the gringo trail).     

El Bolsón was not quite worth the trouble and time but they did have an interesting <em>feria artesanal</em> (crafts fair). Some unique woodwork and knitting, homemade incense, and great empanadas: just what you would expect from a south american hippy commune.  We hiked up to a mirador overlooking a clear river just as the sunset and then back to the bus stop to return to the big city Bariloche, not very eventful excursion but worth a couple sentences I guess.
