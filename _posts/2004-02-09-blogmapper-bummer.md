It does create an <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=697&topic=36">Atom</a> feed tho.

Apparently you have to have a Blogger Pro account to get an RSS feed.  The catch is that they are currently not accepting orders for upgrades (once again crap!).

In the mean time, I'm looking into MapBureau's other solutions...
