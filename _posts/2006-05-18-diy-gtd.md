I&rsquo;ve recently been given some web design projects to work on for the next few weeks while in Ecuador.  So today as i am getting back into the swing of work I somehow became distracted (for better or worse, is still to be determined) by this new thing floating around the web being blogged, highly praised and supported mainly by the mac geek / programmer / web designer / blogger crowd.  Its commonly tagged as GTD which stands for a productivity technique coined by <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen's</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ws%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0142000280%2526tag=ws%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0142000280%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Getting Things Done</a>.   There's lots of support and ideas (AJAX websites (like <a href="http://43folders.com/">43folders.com</a>, downloadable software plugins to your favorite apps such as "<a href="http://www.kinkless.com/">Kinkless</a>") popping up around the idea, and incase you dont want to buy the book you can get an idea of what its all about from the MineZone site's <a href="http://www.minezone.org/wiki/MVance/GettingThingsDone">notes</a> from the book. I have particularly picked up on the idea of the formalized idea about a <em><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/">hipster pda</a></em> and found some <a href="http://www.diyplanner.com/templates/official/hpda">useful cutout templates</a> to printout and use on index cards, to get organized, motivated, and productive.
