I found another way to link blogposts geographical locations to an image with PointMapper, yet another solution from MapBureau.  Unfortunately, this one doesnt have all of the automated functionality that I originally wanted... but i think it will do fine, and anyway it will have to work for now! Here is my first test. I want to show you my first destination on the map.  Click: **Quito, Ecuador** to show a point on the map.

The map requires Flash enabled browser.  You can use the tool bar to zoom in and out as well as other functionality.
