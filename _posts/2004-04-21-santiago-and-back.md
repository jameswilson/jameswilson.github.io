We left for Santiago, 6 hours away on Sunday and arrived and got picked up by tom in the Government van with diplomatic plates. It was pretty cool to say the least. <!--more--> We hung out that night and then monday morning, Tom had rented a car, so we hopped in along with his girlfriend Angelica and headed on a road trip... to none other than La Serena.  We went straight back where we had just left. But the trip was cool and we got to go up into the **Valle de Elqui** where they make Pisco, a local liquor, and tour the distillery. We drove way up into the end of the valley in search of another winery, but  by the time we got there it was closed.  Tom treated us to a bottle of Chivas Regal and I passed out while they proceeded to get smashed in the hotel room that night. We stayed in La Serena until wednesday when we drove back down the coastline to **Valparaiso** and **Vina del Mar**, where Angelica was from and we ate at a damn good mexican restaurant for dinner and then drove back to Santiago. Vi√±a is quite a tourist luxury resort town and it was quite beautiful even though we only saw it by night.
