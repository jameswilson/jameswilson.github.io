Being one of few (active) members of the <a title="The Hospitality Club" href="http://hospitalityclub.org" target="_blank">HospitalityClub.org</a> and <a title="Couch Surfing" href="http://couchsurfing.com" target="_blank">CouchSurfing.com</a> living in Cuenca, Ecuador, I have the  really nice opportunity to be contacted by lots of people traveling through ecuador.  On my profiles, I advertise my willingness to help people with any questions they have. I've been receiving travel questions for quite a few months now and always try to be as detailed as possible in my responses, and so decided to start logging them here on my blog for posterity and to be able to refer people to view my views on my website, given that providing a link, albeit not heartwarming as a personal response, is 1000 times more useful and efficient that responding with the same answer twice.
