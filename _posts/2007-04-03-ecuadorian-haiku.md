On a sunny Ecuadorian morning a few days ago, I awoke with something funny in my head.  From the depths of the warm cocoon that is my alpaca blanket, I jotted down on the nearest sheet of paper a few lines of <em>haiku</em> that flowed out without much forethought or effort.

Funny how Zen just happens to disappear and reappear in my life with surprising spontaneity. This doesn't happen often, mind you, but perhaps it was brought on by a recent bout of meditation in combination with some independent research I've been getting more and more involved with along the lines of self-knowledge. Perhaps a simple occurrence of "Syncronicity":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncronicity more than anything else.

<!--break--><h3>Isolation</h3>

For some reason, all these haiku have come out with a distinct feeling of serenity and loneliness, so i applied the theme "isolation" to the title of this article.

:: *chameleon*

climate fluctuates-
little color changer waits
basking on a stone

<!--break-->

:: *a stroll*

dew drop turns to frost
crossing the park through the grass-
crisp and clear the sound!

:: *wandering*

lonely traveler
welcoming rain on his back
many months from home

:: *snowsounds*

owl greets the snowfall
silent night and wide awake
fieldmouse heeds the tune
