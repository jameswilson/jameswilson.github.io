To cross to Tierra del Fuego you have to cross the Straight of Magellan or <em>Estrecho de Magallanes</em> at Bahia Azul (blue bay). The ordeal was pretty nifty and cold, we waited for the ferry to arrive while looking into the clear waters seeing <em>straight</em> (heh, heh, heh) down to the bottom, someone said they saw a small whale, but i missed it. We looked across a couple kilometers to the other side that looked a lot like the side we were on. We took a picture and then crossed. On the ferry I ate a hot dog with mayo, mustard, and ketchup. First hot dog on the trip, cause it was the only thing they had to offer, FYI. A short story by me.
