To cross to Tierra del Fuego you have to cross the Straight of Magellan or *Estrecho de Magallanes* at Bahia Azul (blue bay). The ordeal was pretty nifty and cold, we waited for the ferry to arrive while looking into the clear waters *seeing straight* (heh, heh, heh) down to the bottom, someone said they saw a small whale, but I missed it.

We looked across a couple kilometers to the other side that looked a lot like the side we were on. We took a picture and then crossed. On the ferry I ate a hot dog with mayo, mustard, and ketchup. First hot dog on the trip, because it was the only thing they had to offer.
