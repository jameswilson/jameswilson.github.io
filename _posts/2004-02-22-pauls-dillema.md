So my travel mate Paul has been trying to get a job with Lockheed Martin, but they keep pulling him along and not giving him an answer... His situation is this: either he gets the sweet job working in Kosovo making mucho $$... or he doesnt and gets to travel South America with me.  Either way it works out for him! But since I had that remedial driving course and was going to miss most of Carnaval, I decided to wait on Paul to get ready.  We haven't purchased tickets to SA yet and he still doesnt have a final answer from Lockheed. They said they would tell him this friday.   Clock's ticking....
