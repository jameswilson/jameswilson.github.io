Welcome to WordPress. I just made the switch today to paid hosting at DreamHost.com and couldnt be happier living a free life.  <!--more--> I highly recommend a self-hosted Worpress installtion running on DreamHost over Blogger, because they have dependable servers and a very affordable plan that now gives you 4700 MB of disk space,  120 GB/Month bandwidth, and tons of other great goodies to help you get your very own personally managed website.  They provide easy "One-click install" of WordPress and many other useful web content management tools.  But I have to admit that i did run into problems with the Blogger to WordPress Import mechanism.  As usual, a few minutes spent on google found my solution and within 30 minutes I was hapily up and running.  Now comes the process of customising the site to my hearts content.  yippie!
