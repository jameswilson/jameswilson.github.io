We didnt really see any reason to hang around Lima for any period of time because we were really motivated to get through Peru to get down to Chile  while the weather was still good. We had about 2 hours befor catching another bus to Nazca, Peru so we walked down to the center of town and checked out these really awesome catacombs underneath the Monasterio de San Fransisco. There were apparently 40000 people burried underneath the cathedral and the tour was quite funny because we got tossed in with a group of 14 young peruvian boys, probably of the age of 10 or 11.   Some were quite scared and there were tons of bones and skulls and all arranged in a pattern at the bottom of this huge round well.  The tour guide said it was 10 meters deep of bones.
