Here is a link to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cruise_the_planet/">Dave and Kel's personal travel website </a>where you can find <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cruise_the_planet/atacama.html">Pictures </a>of us (Dave, Kel, Eran, Paul and I) on the 3 day trek throuh Atacama desert and the Salt Flats of Uyuni in Bolivia with our guide Javier and his wife. Its a geocities website so the pictures might take a while to load... or might not load at all. anyway, cheers... isnt that landscape just amazaing!

**UPDATE** Aparently this website has been taken offline.  I unfortunately do not have contact information for Dave and Kel so these pics are lost forever until I can contact them!
