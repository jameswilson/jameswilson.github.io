Found this interesting quote from an article by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">Paul Graham</a>:

> Some kinds of waste really are disgusting. SUVs, for example, would arguably be gross even if they ran on a fuel which would never run out and generated no pollution. SUVs are gross because they're the solution to a gross problem. (How to make minivans look more masculine.)
