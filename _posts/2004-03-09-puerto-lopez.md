After a great time spent in the Surf Town of Montañita, we left sunday evening on the Ruta del Sol (Basically the north/south route along the coast of Ecuador) headed north towards Puerto Lopez.  The town is on a nice large bay and the town is a popular tourist destination in the high season of June through September where boats usher tourists 40 km out to sea to the Isla de la Plata to see killer whales.  The island is also called <em>Galapagos for the Poor </em> because you can go there for much cheaper and see some exotic animals. Well we were on a budget and decided to instead take an even cheaper trip with a local fisherman out to a nearby island, Isla Salagos, to do some fishing and some snorkling around the small reef there. It was a long day under the sun and right now my back is on fire as i write this.  We caught some cool fish including a 1 lb. guavina, a 2 lb. aguja, and a 6 lb. guayaipe which we brought back and Paco, the capitan cooked up for us. It was quite tastey. Today we leave for the north once again going to Cruzita to try to do some hanggliding (for $15 bucks!!) and then to Bahía de Caráquez to see some cool caves.
