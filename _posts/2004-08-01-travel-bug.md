Near the end of my trip (actually the day I was supposed to be back in the USA - ah the irony) I caught the south american travel bug after eating a seafood burrito. It was the most expensive thing on the menu and at US$4.50, I even found myself complaining about the price! (Almost as much as one night stay at my penthouse suite in the little beach town of Montanita Ecuador). It was a delicious plate, but it effectively ruined the next few days of my life in what was supposed to be a relaxing time at the beach with Carolina and her family. I made it through the night only vomiting twice but with innumerable intestine-expunging sessions on the porcelain throne. ![951696][medium][alignright] The next day i traveled for one hour to arive at the nearest military hospital. It was quite possibly the longest and worse vehicle ride in all of south america,  only to be followed up by a series of blood tests, pills, and IVs interspersed with dreadfully gross trips to the can. The doctors there took excellent care of me and made me feel MUCH better. The experience left me extremely weak and deeply endebted to the family and the helpful doctors at the military hospital in Salinas.   After the stay in the hospital overnight i went back into the Andes where I spend nearly a week inturned at Carol's house where her beautiful and loving family welcomed me and took very good care of me.
