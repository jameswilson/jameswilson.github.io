Senryū is a Japanese form of short poetry similar to haiku in construction but tend to be about human foibles while haiku tend to be about nature. Senryu are often cynical or darkly humorous while haiku are serious.

tilled Andean hillside

under alpaca yarns

all of Ecuador shivers

<!--break-->

safely locked posessions

traveler returns home

key lost in the dark

sleepless

a series of Senryū

swiftly surfaced

lay man prays

but quietly hates

the next day

family asleep

in separate rooms

peace at last

ink stains cross

scattered and wrinkled papers

another caffeinated night

As a beginner, this is my first attempt at writing senryu. This series tries to maintain the recurrent theme of sleep and darkness.  I feel like some of my first attempts here lack the essence of true senryu, however, I'm keeping my head up.
