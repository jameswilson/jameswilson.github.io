We left Canoa after a nice three days relaxing at the Posada de Daniel and headed further north to **Atacames** in the province of **Esmeraldas** a slightly more touristy beach town than we had been at along our coastal journey. Apparently this is a closer place for quiteños (people from Quito) can reach for a getaway vacation than the other smaller beach towns down the coast of Manabi.

We arrived hours past sundown and found a really shitty place right on the *malecón* -- the main beachfront strip that most beach towns have. The beds lacked any kind of padding and I could feel the boards underneath supporting the mattress. The Saturday night music blared all night from the row of 25+ seaside huts across the street, but strangely there weren't that many people out when we decided to take a walk to check out the scene.  I think they turn up the volume to try to bring more people out.

The next day we woke up late and went for a walk down the sea-side strip again.  The beach was very wide and probably 4 km long. Towards both ends the steep mountain cliffs seemed to come right down to the sand. For lunch we decided to try the *ceviche* a cold seafood soup marinated with lime juice and garnished with tomatos, onions, and cilantro.  I had the *ceviche de camaron* (shrimp) and Paul tried the *mixto* mixed with various kinds of shell fish and shrip. Definitely worth repeating.

This would be the last beach we would be seeing for a while, so we took our last swim in the ocean and drank a few beers as we watched probably the best sunset we’ve seen yet dip down between the southern cliffs that drop to the sea and a small island right off shore. Tomorrow we head into Quito, 6 and a half hours inland.
