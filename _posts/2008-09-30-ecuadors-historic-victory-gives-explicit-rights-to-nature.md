The exit polls of the September 28th election showed a wide margin of support for approval of the new Ecuadorian constitution, in what President Rafael Correa claimed as an "historic victory".  There are indeed a handful of interesting chapters of the constitution that not only reform Ecuadorian's state institutions and personal rights, but also <a title="Approved Language For Ecuadorian Constitution" href="http://www.celdf.org/Default.aspx?tabid=538" target="_blank">rights for nature to run its course</a>.  There are clauses for State supported programs to deter human exploitation of non-renewable resources, destruction of ecosystems, and giving explicit rights to nature for an "integral restoration".  It also states that any person can demand to any governmental agency that these rights be upheld, and may be arbitrated in a court of law.
