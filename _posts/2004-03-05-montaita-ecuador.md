We arrived in Montañita on Wednesday just after sunset, the ride was incredible along the coast. the bus drove through little pueblos on the side of the road and everyone was cooking dinner and the smell was great! It was my first sunset over the Pacific Ocean and it was excellent.

We met up with my buddy Jim in town and he set us up with a room in the Hotel where he worked as a cook.  This pueblo has a definite Bohemian feel to it, lots of truly earthy people, artisans, musicians, etc.  This town is at the foot of where the mountainous country begins and the scenery was great.  The hotel had a guitar and I got a good dose of jamming in while I was there.  I met an eccentric Rastafarian named David, an artisan from Colombia who was very friendly and explained a lot to be about the Rasta. The town is a surf town but the surf wasn't up very much while we were there so I didn't rent a board.  Maybe further up the coast we can find more waves.  The first night there I didn't sleep well because of cocks crowing, dogs howling, pigeons landing on the roof, donkeys &rsquo;hee-hawing&rsquo;,  hammers and saws pounding away.  By the third night we got used to it and it became a refreshing change from the trains planes and automobile horns that i heard constantly at my place in Raleigh.
