After graduating in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, and a few brief stints of corporate work, I left for an extended sabatical to travel the world and ended up settling in Cuenca, Ecuador in 2006.

I turned to web development to sustain my travels and began learning the emerging Web standards of the day. In 2007 and '08, as the number of website projects steadily increased, I began compiling my ideas into a reusable custom <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> written in Classic ASP VBScript.

As the inevitable frustration grew with being the sole maintainer of a codebase written in an aging *closed-source* programming language, I turned to PHP, Drupal, and the thriving open source community —  embracing the concept of <em>standing on the shoulders of giants</em> instead of writing everything from scratch.

Today I contribute primarily to Drupal and various other Open Source projects on GitHub.
